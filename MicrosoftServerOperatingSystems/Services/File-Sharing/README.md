# File Sharing

- There are two security systems for sharing files
    - NTFS Permissions (Security tab)
    - Sharing Permissions (Sharing tab)

- Because there are two security systems
    - Sharing permissions only kick in when people come in over the share
    - NTFS permissions always apply no matter how the file is accessed

- Permissions can be inherited from the folder(s) the file is stored in, but this can be disabled.

- If there are two conflicting entries, usually the stricter entry wins

- Permissions utilize ALLOW or DENY - Don't use deny unless you have to, it will overcomplicate things - If you are not on the list, you are implicitly denied
